    markdown:
      "# Weapon Spotlight: MP5 (MW)\n\nLet's give a warm welcome to an absolute veteran of Verdansk:  the Modern Warfare MP5. As Call of Duty fans have come to know and love about the MP5 in a CoD game, it's good. As dependable and iconic as the MP5 is, it would have been a real disappointment if this weapon were to have become a flop in Warzone. But, thankfully, the developers stayed true to their roots and made sure that the Modern Warfare MP5 packs plenty of push in this edition of its legendary story.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/mp5-mw.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nAs an original member of the Modern Warfare Warzone lineup, the MW MP5 has been in the game since release. It is a really unique weapon in one aspect: It has always been viable. Most guns in Warzone shift in and out of the meta as guns get buffed, get nerfed, and as more guns get added. However, the MW MP5 has almost always retained a unique position in players' loadouts as a candidate for frequent use.\n\nIn its time on the battlefield, this gun has received very few nerfs or buffs in and of itself. This weapon really is considered a balanced option in the Warzone lineup and deserves the high praise that it has received over the duration of the game's life.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nIn order to unlock the Modern Warfare MP5, all a player must do is download the game, turn it on, and play until the have reached Level 12. At that point, the MW MP5 will be unlocked and the player will be awarded with a steady option for short range gameplay.\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n\nWhere the MW MP5 shines its brightest is within 10 meters. At this range, this weapon can kill in 8 shots with a time to kill of 526 when hitting the chest and 6 shots with a time to kill of 376 when hitting the head. Peeking around time to kills for various weapons around Verdansk, that makes for one of the best (if not, the best) time to kill at any range for any weapon. That speaks volumes by itself about the potential that this weapon packs into such a small frame.\n\n - Control\n\nThe MW MP5 is really unique to Warzone in that it is a true hip-fire weapon. The hip-fire accuracy drawn out by the reticle on this weapon is unparalleled, giving it a really unique use case when it comes to control. Hip-firing is much different than shooting down sight so players need to have developed this skill when it comes time for them to try to use this gun. This is not to say, though, that the MW MP5 can't be used at slight ranges. Depending on the attachments that are placed onto the weapon, it can be extremely steady and easy to control as a compact submachine gun.\n\n - Fire Rate\n\nThe fire rate of the MW MP5 is actually an unexpected shortcoming of this weapon. Given that it is indeed a submachine gun, you might be expecting a pretty high fire rate for a top-tier SMG - but you won't find it here. As a matter of fact, this MP5 is well-below average in this department when it comes to the current meta submachine guns that you will around Verdansk. Accordingly, players must be mindful of this when they are using this gun and plan around this fire rate deficit.\n\n - Range\n\nThe range on this gun is a little different depending on how the player decides that they want to build out the weapon with its attachments. Decked out for hip firing, this weapon is meant to be used as a room-to-room threat. When dressed up for this dance, the gun will be really bouncy when aimed down sights and make for somewhat difficult aiming. However, when the weapon is given attachments for aiming down sights, the range on this gun can compete with even some Assault Rifles.\n\n - Mobility\n\nThe mobility that is offered by this weapon makes for a really fun experience. As this weapon lends itself to hip firing, the strafe speed on this weapon is quite high and, when given attachments that accent that characteristic, this MP5 becomes a speedy killer. The aim down sights speed on this weapon is particularly fascinating as it competes for the top spot in this characteristic, making it a nice candidate for those who wish to try to take out multiple opponents in a row.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/mp5-loady.png)\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nThere are two different ways to build out this weapon so that it lends itself for two different situations: hip firing and aiming down sights. The more common (and interesting) use case is to go for the hip firing so we are going to cover that here.\n\nTo create the best hip-fire MW MP5, here's the setup. First, Monolithic Suppressor so you can stay sneaky. Then, you will want to apply the FTAC Collapsible stock for movement gains. After that, Merc Foregrip turns the hip firing accuracy of this gun way up. After slapping on some 45 Round Mags to make sure that you can sustain fire as long as you will need to, Sleight of Hand comes in at the end to make sure that you can stay prepared no matter what enemy teams are throwing at you in Verdansk.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nAs a mainstay to the meta in Call of Duty Warzone, the Modern Warfare MP5 has held its own across time and space. This gun is really, really fun to use as a change of pace for submachine guns. Because it is a hip-fire maniac, it begs for a completely different play style and playing experience compared to nearly any other gun you'll find in Verdansk. So, if you're looking to enjoy Warzone in a new way and haven't got around to using the Modern Warfare MP5 yet, be sure to give it a go!",

      "# Tourney Wrap: Sadie Hawkins #3\n\nSadie Hawkins Dance! In our kahki pants! There's nothing betterrrr! Oh, oh, oh!\n\nNow that that's over with, let's have a chat about the third edition of the Sadie Hawkins Tournament put on and organized by eFuse Sports. For this tournament, similar to a high school Sadie Hawkins Dance, players were organized into teams by the players themselves. Female players were assigned with tracking down a male teammate to play the tournament, creating teams of male-female duos that were sure to slay out for a few hours on 7/29/2021. Let's see how things shook out.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/efuse-logo.png)\n\n## Surveying the Field\n\n16 teams made up this Verdansk romp around session, showcasing some seriously star-studded talent. Here are the teams that made up the field:\n\n- Queenluvscake & GooeyGuy\n- QueenShadows & RussDaddy\n- Kalei & Exzachtt\n- Swiphey & zColorss\n- ntShay & Almxnd\n- Flvnks & LouisCM_\n- BrittneyRaines & Tommey\n- Slayerbritt & Flxnked\n- SenseiSwishEm & Intechs\n- TheDanDangler & OP Marked\n- Colliena & Kidkeater\n- XundaeTV & Nickool\n- Misssweets & Aydan\n- KaylaDelancey & Zerby\n- Bossladylilly & Script\n- Smixie & Newbz\n\n## The Format\n\nThe format for this tournament started out as a series of three where the winner of two maps moves on to the next round. These maps were played as 2v2 kill races where players were active on the same iteration of Verdansk. This is pretty much the standard format for competitive Warzone these days as players and viewers alike find that this format culminates in a fair and exciting tournament. This tournament did lack a Loser's Bracket, though, which is something we are accustomed to seeing in a Warzone tournament. But, anyhow, something interesting happened about halfway through the tournament...\n\nThe format changed. Why you ask? Well, the original set of rules included resets for when tourney players encountered hackers. However, as it turned out, there are currently so many hackers in the game that this set of rules couldn't work for how much the players were getting hacked on. As a matter of fact, **in one series, there were 11 resets because of deaths to hackers.** That's right. In three games, the tourney players ran into at least 11 hackers. Wow.\n\nBecause of the games simply couldn't go on like this, the format changed to most amount of kills over the course of two games no matter what. This meant that if anyone got hacked on, they would have to just sort of grin and bear it. Unfortunate? Yes. Necessary? Yeah, we would have to say so.\n\n## Moving Through the Bracket\n\nTaking a quick look around the bracket at the teams, many of the expectations for this tournament that we had were fulfilled. The women's side of these duos played a sort of support role as many of these pairings featured a professional, tourney-hardened player on the male side. We're talking about Almxnd, Flxnked, Intechs, Newbz, and zColorss. The further along that you go down the bracket the more it would seem that the higher the skill of the pro on the team, the further along these teams could manage to get. Quick note: A hacker brought the end to one of the \n\nOne team that we vastly underestimated in this tourney turned out to be XundaeTV & Nickool. We were really excited to see some fresh faces moving through the bracket...and even make it to the finals!\n\n## Finals Recap\n\nTo the finals! Squaring off with Swiphey & zColorss we find XundaeTV & Nickool for the grand prize of $3,000. Let's see how it went! Remember that the rules for this series are now that the most amount of kills after two games is the winner.\n\n- Game 1\n\nGame one looked promising as both teams dropped in and snatched up a few kills with no early mishaps. After collecting some kills, both teams proceeded to grab the loadouts cleanly. Sporting a C58 and PPsh-41, zColorrs ended up having a scary moment (after collecting a 4-6 kills) with a rotation out of what the pros call \"Wager Houses.\" Running completely out in the open with the gas at his back, zColorss got knocked by a team holding him into the gas from Stadium, crawled into a small ditch to self-revive, and managed to get back to his feet and put some plates on. Luckily, he had just earned himself the Durable Gas Mask off of one of the bodies of the players that he killed back in wager houses so he was able to make an extra-wide rotation to the fire station between Downtown and Stadium. There, he hopped into the Cargo Truck that spawns there and eventually made it into Downtown where he joined up with Swiphey.\n\nWith Zones 4 and 5 drawing into the area between Port and Farmland, both teams struggled to gain a solid foothold on the kill race lead. Nickool got full killed in a house in Farmland, prompting zColorrs to aggressively dart over to where he died looking for kills. zColorss got killed in short order, was bought back to life by his teammate, landed on the loadout, and then died within the next 5 seconds, collecting no kills.\n\nNickool then exited the gulag with a late win and dove near his teammate XundaeTV. However, at this point, the zone was creeping into a very awkward position for all three of the reamaining tournaments players and they all ended up getting caught in some crossfire and dying.\n\nAt the end of Game 1, zColorss and Swiphey had earned themselves a 6 kill lead.\n\n- Game 2\n\nTo begin Game 2, both teams landed at hospital. Unfortunately for Nickool and XundaeTV, they both found themselves in the Gulag shortly after touching down on the Verdansk map. zColorss found himself in control of not one but two full health helicopters on the top of the hospital roof. He chose to toss one off the roof and allow it to ghost ride to its explosion so he could hop back into the remaining helicopter to find more opponents to eliminate.\n\nNickool and XundaeTV both won their Gulags and returned to Verdansk ready to go after landing on their Loadout Box. Having flown his helicopter a good portion of the way across the map, zColorss ended up in a tough spot in a battle with a full team of four and found himself in the gulag after dying in the large, blue warehouse south of TV station. He did, however, swiftly win his gulag in dramatic fashion, land on the same loadout that Nickool and XundaeTV had just visited, and immediately killed a player that found himself in a poor position on the TV Station Buy Station. At this point in time, zColorss and Swiphey had managed to pad their existing 6 kill lead with a bit larger of a lead.\n\nLooking for a fight and getting won Nickool and XundaeTV made their way down to the Wager Houses where they found themselves in a bit of a pinch. Nickool got headshot sniped by an enemy player on what appeared to be a nearly impossible angle but XundaeTV was able to revive him almost on the spot. Then, with things starting to look on the up and up, the team discovered how exactly it was that Nickool got downed in such dramatic fashion. Their enemy was aimbotting. And now pushing them. And just like that, both members of the team were dead.\n\nAnd just like that the tourney was over. That was...hmm. Unsatisfying.\n\nAt any rate, this made zColorss and Swiphey the winners of the tournament, taking home a purse of $3,000 to split between themselves.\n\n## Note: Bronze Matchup\n\nIn the bronze matchup, Smixie & Newbz snagged a 19-8 win over the duo of ntShay & Almxnd.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/efuse-small.jpg)",

    title: "What is kittr?",
    markdown:
      "\n\n# What is kittr?\n\nWe're that hip, new thang in the Twitchiverse. We're here to break it down and build it up. We're here to rock - and roll. We want to make *your* Twitch experience better.\n\nLong story short: kittr is a drop-in replacement for that Google Sheet or image links that streamers use to share their kits (AKA loadouts, setups, etc.) with their viewers.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/hero-screenie.svg)\n\n##  Wait, seriously, what is kittr?\n\nkittr is a website (webapp, technically) that allows streamers to share kits and other details about their stream with a level of professionalism that the rest of their stream conveys.\n\nWhen a stream gets large enough, viewers tend to want to know about the kit/loadout/equipment/setup that the streamer is using. In nearly every game these days, there is some sort of player customization that comes into the fold that allows players to truly make the game their own. Whether it be customizing a gun, putting on a different skin, or picking out some different set of character skills that change how you can play the game, those adaptations can lead to gameplay that works out entirely different even in the same game.\n\nAs viewers, this makes for a genuine interest when watching a streamer play their game. \"Wait, how is he shooting so straight? What does he have on his gun?\" Or \"Woah, that character looks SWEET. What belt is that?\" Viewers often want to emulate that awesome gameplay.\n\nSo they ask. \"Hey, what gun is that?\" Maybe the streamer will respond, maybe a mod, maybe the rest of chat. But after long enough, the answer gets a little repetitive - so a command gets added to the chat.\n\nEnter !loadout. Here's the fun part. Nightbot will respond to our dear, curious viewer and hopefully give them an answer that helps them learn something about the gameplay they are watching. In the past, Nightbot would drop a link to a Google Sheet or maybe just write out the answer right there in chat. Both of these solutions create new sets of problems...and that's why we made kittr.\n\n## Why did we build kittr?\n\nLook around Twitch (particularly Warzone as of today).  **Streamers work their butts off to make their stream a fully professional production.** The overlays, the keeping up with chat, the gameplay itself. Everything all the way down to the emotes is well taken care of and clearly given time, energy, and effort.\n\nThen someone types !loadout and it all comes undone.\n\nIn most large streams, !loadout will probably take you to a Google Sheet that has been kinda, sorta made to answer questions about Warzone guns. Moderators and streamers try to maintain this Sheet such that it can answer questions about guns for them. Additionally, a mod will most likely spend a bunch of time and energy trying to make it look good. They'll also probably try to drop some social links in there to spice things up.\n\nBut here's the problem: **A Google Sheet is for accounting. Not sharing Warzone loadouts.**\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/ugly-spreadsheet.jpg)\n\nSpreadsheets are ugly. We're watching video games! Not at work! And, on top of that, try to pull up one of those Sheets on mobile. It's terrible! You can't even see anything! Overall, the entire experience is quite horrid for viewers, especially when you factor in all of the effort that goes into making the stream itself so amazing!\n\nWhile using a Google Sheet for this purpose might *kinda sorta* get the job done...couldn't things be so much better? We thought so. So we made this.\n\n## The New Kid on The Block\n\nWe know that we're new to this and there is an already established way of doing things. But we **know** that we have a serious solution to a clear problem.\n\n### Why We're Better than a Sheet\n\nWell, we already talked about how we're better for viewers. But we've got more reasons than that.\n\nLet's talk about the moderator experience. With a Google Sheet, moderators are simply punching in text. That leads to typos, mis-formatting, and inconsistencies. But, with kittr, you're done typing. We already have all of the appropriate attachments for every weapon in our database. You just click on which ones you want to apply to the weapon, save, and you're done. No hassle, no fuss, no mess, no muss.\n\nAdditionally, you mods don't have to spend ANY effort trying to make everything look good. We took on the heavy lifting of that part and made sure that our designs are modern, beautiful, and provide a great user experience. In the dashboard, moderators can collaborate on kits with each other in real-time and work faster, more accurately, and more easily.\n\n### Why We're Better than a Simple Text Command\n\nOkay, we've grinded our axe at Google Sheets enough. Some of you may be saying, \"Yeah, in our stream, we just have text responses when somebody puts in a command. That works well enough.\" To that, we have a few things to say.\n\n 1. Chat is for building a community.\nIt's a place for people to talk to each other. It's a place for interaction. It's a place where the community gets together for good times. It's not a place for gun commands to clog up the conversation everyone is trying to have. Imagine trying to talk to someone and suddenly MONOLITHIC SUPPRESSOR TASK FORCE BARREL RANGER FOREGRIP 50 ROUND MAGS. *No one liked that.* So, you can see how kittr helps your community continue talking instead of dodging commands.\n2. We already formatted things for you.\nUpdating a command can be sort of annoying. You're probably going to have to go find the old one to copy its format, highlight, re-type, clean it up, make sure things are good...oh, he already changed it again so now I have to circle back and...Yeah, on kittr, you would have been done with this already. As we've mentioned before, you get to tap into our database so that a loadout update can be as simple as two clicks and about 10 seconds tops.\n\n### Early Feedback has been EXTRAORDINARY\n\nWe've been **absolutely floored** by the feedback that we have received after only two weeks after release. Viewers have loved us. Mods have adored us. And streamers have given us testimonials that we thought were only going to happen in our dreams. We're super proud of what we have accomplished thus far.\n\nBut we want everyone to know right here, right now: we're just getting started.",

    title: "Player Spotlight: Stukawaki",
    markdown:
      "\n\n# Player Spotlight: Stukawaki\n\nkittr welcomes Stukawaki to the roster!\n\nAs one of our first players to join the platform, Stukawaki is perhaps one of the most underappreciated Warzone streamers, in our absolutely expertly professional opinion. We feel extremely lucky to have Stukawaki and his stream as a part of our platform and know that there is way more to come in Stu's Warzone career.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/stukawaki-logo.png)\n\n## About\n\nWhile we all know and love him as \"Stu,\" it turns out his real name is Ethan. Ethan is Hawaiian by birth and still currently lives there in O'ahu. Not too much is out and about there as far as Stu's bio goes but, honestly, he's Hawaiian and that's enough for us to know he's a cool dude.\n\n## What's in a Name?\n\nCommon question: What in the world is a Stukawaki? To be honest, when we first read the name and saw that he's Hawaiian, we thought it was his name with something really Hawaiian sounding tacked on the end. However, we now know that that is not the case.\n\nInstead, according to the stream's bot command for !name, it turns out that the \"kawaki\" bit comes from Boruto, Naruto's son while the \"stu\" part comes from Tsunami, a friend's sister's name. Together, that makes \"stukawaki.\" Honestly, sounds pretty good to us.\n\n## Stream History\n\nStu began streaming Warzone in 2020 and rose in popularity quite quickly based on his playing ability. Looking back through view counts, Stu has seen a steady rise in viewership despite the fact that he streams at odd hours due to living in Hawaii. It is our full belief that, if the move to Texas really does materialize for Stu, streaming at more usual times of day will allow Stu to gain a serious following rivaling the best in the competitive Call of Duty Warzone community.\n\n## Play Style\n\nThere is really only one way to describe the play style of Stukawaki: slayer. Stu combines a pristine sense of awareness with incredible aiming skill to deal massive amounts of damage to enemies while still maintaining a great deal of health for himself. You'll find clips upon clips of Stu 1v4'ing players in Verdansk that put on display the qualities of a true Warzone mastermind.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/stu.jpg)\n\n## Tournament Winnings\n\nIn just a short amount of time, Stukawaki has amassed a small fortune when it comes to tournament winnings on the Warzone scene. Altogether, Stu has won approximately $105,000 in 17 tournaments in his time playing Call of Duty.\n\nLet's look at some details on some of his top performances:\n\n - Atlanta Faze Gold Rush: 1st Place\n\nDuo'ed up with fellow kittr roster member JoeWo, Stukawaki took the grand prize on 5/5/2021 winning an online Warzone tournament with a seriously interesting purse. Typically, cash gets handed out for these things. But this time, our two grand prize winners took him two gold bars valued at $56k each. How about that for a day at the office.\n- Chipotle Challenger Series II\n\nOn 7/16/2021, Stukawaki continued some earlier winnings ways by taking home the grand prize for this tournament. He didn't win any burritos - but I'm sure the $12,500 that he did come away from this tourney with did buy a nice steak dinner for himself and his teammate for this tournament, UnRationaL.\n- Twitch Rivals: Call of Duty: Warzone Season 6 Showdown (NA)\n\nIn an $100,000 Twitch Rivals tournament, everyone gets to take home some scratch. However, nobody walked away more of a winner than Stukawaki on 10/23/2021. Picking up a combined purse of $20,9000, Stu and his teammate Parasite split that bag evenly to enrich their gaming lives just a little bit more that day.\n- Vikkstar's Warzone Showdown 2: Week 3\n\nIf it isn't our good friend JoeWo once again! This dynamic duo drew up another great day for themselves in a tournament dominated by overseas talent. In brackets that were sure to feature many EU servers, these two battled ping and great competition to take the top spot in a star-studded tournament to take home a group purse of $6,000.\n\n## Stu Gets Banned?\n\nFolks, every once in awhile, the folks behind Warzone really do get serious about waging a battle against cheating going on in the game. It just so happens that they aren't very good at it - even when they try.\n\nWhile playing a tournament one day, Stu suddenly disconnected from the game. His stream stayed on, he remained in his Discord channel speaking to his friend...so it's not an internet issue? Suddenly on his screen, Stu receives a message saying \"Your account has been permanently banned for cheating.\"\n\n**Mid. Tournament.**\n\nAfter a moment of serious confusion, Stu got in touch with Activision staff to figure out what was going on and found out that, yes, he indeed had been banned for cheating. This, of course, was an erroneous claim. We're all watching the guy play the game. He's just really good at it.\n\nUnfortunately, Stu was unable to play the rest of the tournament while Activision and Co. tried to get their heads on straight about how exactly they had just banned one of the best competitive performers in their game. After a day or so, Stu's account was reinstated so that he could play the game again, although he did miss out on an opportunity to compete the day before.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: C58",
    markdown:
      "\n# Weapon Spotlight: C58\n\nWith Season Four out now, Call of Duty: Warzone got some interesting weapon rebalances that turned the C58 into a meta weapon. This Assault Rifle has some interesting aspects that give it a really unique feel that's fun to use while still effective. Let's explore what makes this thing tick.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/c58.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nWhen the C58 first got introduced to Warzone, it actually found its way into ground loot. kittr staff and friends quickly noticed that it hit quite hard and that the control was decent for ground loot. However, the weapon didn't find its way into the meta too quickly as players tried out different weapons first.\n\nIn a recent patch, the C58 did receive a buff, though, turning it into a much more desirable choice for many players. The 4x scope received a significant recoil reduction - which was shortly rescinded. However, as more players got used to using the C58 and finding out about the damage output that it wields, it turns out that the C58 is now enjoyed by many.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nThe C58 is a part of the free battle pass at Tier 31. Once unlocked, you'll grind it out to pick up all your attachments.\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n \nFirst and foremost, we have to talk about the damage output on the C58 as this is its marquee positive feature. Sitting at a time to kill of 655 for chest shots and 436 for head shots, this rifle has strength that can rival even many LMGs. It takes just seven shots to kill when hitting the chest and five shots to kill with headshots to get through enemy armor and health with this weapon. Putting up numbers like that, it's no wonder that many players across Verdansk are defending themselves with a C58 at range.\n\n - Control\n \nThe recoil pattern on the C58 doesn't leave too much to be desired either. While there are options out there that will require less vertical recoil control, the horizontal recoil is minimal with the right setup of attachments. Taken holistically, the recoil of the C58 is easier to manipulate than many other competitive weapons when comparing across damage numbers. Because of this combination of good power and manageable recoil, this weapon earns itself a top spot.\n\n - Fire Rate\n \nNow, here is a clear shortcoming of the C58. The power of the C58 is obvious but the fire rate brings the weapon back down to Earth. The fire rate is quite slow, making the gun a sort of \"high risk\" option when it comes to missing shots. At such a slow fire rate, the difference between hitting every shot and missing even one extra bullet can mean a staggering difference in time to kill. Because of this, great aim will be rewarded while poor aiming will be punished.\n\n - Range\n \nThe range of the C58 is yet another strength of the weapon. As an Assault Rifle, players expect that this gun should be able to perform at most reasonable ranges that can be found around the map of Verdansk. Tested at most usual ranges, the C58 clearly shows that its numbers for damage drop-off are outstanding as it maintains its strength downrange. As long as you can manage the recoil to hit the shot, the C58 is going to deliver excellent damage potential even at long ranges.\n\n - Mobility\n \nLooking at the other characteristics for the C58, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise to find out that mobility is a shortcoming of the C58. You'll be bogged down whenever you have the C58 out and at the ready to fire. Here is where you find the real trade-off between mobility and mortality. The C58 reveals itself here as a true \"stand-and-deliver\" type gun where you simply want to outshoot your opponent. Luckily, as we have chronicled, the weapon will do its job when it comes to putting out the damage with this style. The question is: Will you hit the shot?\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/c58-loady.png)\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using.\n\nAs we take a quick look around, we're finding out that the 3x Axial Arms optic is about as close to a given as possible (although some players are picking out the 4x scope). Of course, a suppressor is almost always a given in Warzone so you'll see nearly everyone sporting the Agency Suppressor on the C58. Next, we're noticing that the 18.5\" Task Force barrel is also looking like a favorite among our roster due to the fact that its pros vastly outweigh its cons. Lastly, we're seeing that some additional rounds are required beyond the default clip of 30 rounds. Most players are opting for the STANAG 55 Rnd selection here - but you might find that you want a smaller clip for some aim-down-sight quickness. After that, it looks like we are seeing some other interesting customizations to improve aim-down-sight speeds that vary decently so we'll let you decide on your fifth attachment.\n\n## Wrap It Up\nTaken together, the characteristics of the C58 paint it as a \"tank\" of a weapon. The damage numbers of this weapon really set the tone to make at an LMG living inside of an ARs body. The mobility is low, the fire rate is slow, but the damage is outstanding. Controlling the firearm takes some getting used to but is more than manageable for an astute player. All in all, the C58 shines in the hands of a high-skill player that can hit those shots, control recoil, and manage a slow fire rate in tight engagements.",

      "\n# Who created Kittr?\n## Hi, I'm Anthony\n\nI am a web developer, gamer, and retired baseball player. Although I am only 27, it’s been a journey getting to the point of creating kittr which happened pretty organically.\n\nGoing way back, I think playing rec hockey got me into gaming. We got our first Playstation setup when I was only four or five to play NHL Hockey. I loved spending time with my dad imagining myself as the players on the Ducks with the game announcer calling out my player’s name when he scored a goal. With that, I was hooked.\n\nOf course it didn’t take long before I was playing Super Mario Bros and Crash Bandicoot. I played PC games like The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and Toontown, too. Man, those were the DAYS.\n\nBy middle school, I had graduated to Playstation 3 and Xbox, and started playing games like Call of Duty and MLB. At the same time, I had shifted to playing baseball on travel teams and wasn’t really the most social guy. If I wasn’t playing baseball, I was gaming pretty much all the time that I could. It was around this time that Supercheats came out and this was revelatory, not because I wanted to cheat but being competitive, I always wanted to find an edge.\n\nAs a pretty competitive person, I liked to find new ways to get ahead. I could watch other people play to see how they beat a certain level or challenge. I would have loved to grow up with streamers. My version of it was setting up my room with several TVs, inviting my three of my friends over, and we all played at the same time, taking breaks to watch each other. Somehow, we never graduated to the point of having full on LAN battles. It just never crossed our little minds that that was an option like it did for so many.\n\nThrough high school, I was still playing a lot of baseball and taking classes that could get stressful - but gaming was always a go-to so I could let off steam and just let my mind take a break. It was always easy to fall into a game and be somewhere else entirely. I got pretty into Call of Duty in high school through all of its many iterations.\n\nWhen I went to college playing baseball at University of San Francisco, I majored in Business and then went on to play professionally as a pitcher for the AAA Cardinals up until last year. Being on the road and away from friends and family, gaming definitely filled the little free time. Playing Fortnite and COD also kept me connected to my brother who was still living at home with my parents.\n\nAround this time I also got interested in teaching myself to program. I found online lessons and just...kinda taught myself. I practiced just creating basic stuff and then eventually did some gig work via some online freelancing platforms.\n\nI feel like everyone has a story about COVID hitting, so here’s how it affected my life. I had been hit by a comebacker while on the mound and ended up having surgery on my pitching arm. So I was down for a bit but rehabbed into better-than-ever shape. And yet, the season was cancelled just as we were barely getting to spring training in 2020. Without a season, I had tons of time - and so did my buddy Mitch. We started working together in web development.\n\nI honestly got a little addicted to programming but was still gaming when I could. As the web development work became a more realistic business option, I had a tough decision to make - go back to minor league baseball, or retire and dive completely into web development - which also allowed me to be home with my wife and dog.\n\nI’m sure for many of you reading this, quitting professional sports just as things seemed to be looking up seems like such an idiotic thing to do. However, I promise you one thing: Being a professional athlete is not all it seems. It most certainly is not for everyone and it isn’t the perfect life to lead like it seems like on TV. For me, it was time to change directions and I retired from baseball putting all my energy into business and the homefront.\n\nNot even a week after retiring, while watching a stream one day with a programmer’s eye, it occurred to me while looking at a Google Sheet for loadouts that these could look and feel a lot more professional. Here were these top-ranked streamers with loadouts that looked like accountant’s spreadsheets and just didn’t match everything else. Hello, opportunity. I should create a program that fixes this awful experience.\n\nWith the stream still open on my second monitor, I just sat and drew up in my graphic design software what I was picturing in my head. From there I hopped around a couple different streams and just showed the idea to a couple mods. To my shock, I got reactions like “OH MY GOSH CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE THAT PLEASE”, “wait dude thats actually sick how do i make one”, and “DUDE. Great idea!” Huh.\n\nOn a family trip for my brother’s graduation, I talked to my wife and family about my idea. I got everyone’s input and realized...I should do this. I immediately went about setting it up with the help of my sister Ashley. You’ll see her blog post next, stay tuned.\n\nNow. I am pretty happy with kittr. But there are WAY more ideas on improvements and additions that are coming down the pipeline. I just need more hours in the day and twice as many hands.\n\nThis thing is going to be a streamer and mods dream. I promise.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: MP5 (CW)",
    markdown:
      "\n\n# Weapon Spotlight: MP5 (CW)\n\nWhat's up, Cold War MP5! Here's a really interesting weapon that has grown into the hands of many players despite getting passed up early on. The Cold War MP5 can be seen dropping enemies all around Verdansk as it has quickly rose to prominence in the hands of some extremely talented players. Let's check out what makes this thing so interesting and why you may want to give it a run to see if you like it, too.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/mp5-cw.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nIntroduced as a core member of the Cold War lineup when Cold War weaponry was added to the Warzone scene, this submachine is the 1984 take on a gun that was already cruising around in Verdansk since the birth of Warzone. The Modern Warfare MP5 had been a mainstay of the Verdansk meta throughout the life of the game. Was the Cold War version coming now to take its place?\n\nWell, to answer that question in a word, no. As it turned out, the CW MP5 went vastly underappreciated by much of the player base when it was first introduced into the game. Few and far between was this weapon's usage, prompting a decent buff to the weapon by the game's creators. Post-buff, the new MP5 actually took over the close-range scene in nearly every map of Verdansk being played - prompting a slight nerf.\n\nHaving been brought back down to a level where other weapons were usable again at near ranges, the CW MP5 now sits in a comfortable place where players still like using it but it hasn't completely taken over the game.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nIn order to unlock the Cold War MP5 for Warzone, a player simply needs to level up to Level 4. That's it. Now go enjoy it, fella.\n\n## Break It Down\n - Damage\n\nOkay, let's get into the nitty gritty of this weapon. As always, we're going to check in with the damage numbers first to find out how well you are going to get rewarded for your great aim. With a 562 time to kill using 9 bullets for chest shots, the CW MP5 clearly shows that it is out for blood. But here's the really interesting part. If you can manage it, headshots with this gun will be very highly rewarded. Using just 6 bullets to create a time to kill of just 351 within 10 meters, the Cold War MP5 hits like a freight train in close quarters.\n - Control\n\nControlling the Cold War MP5 is where things start to get a little dicey. The recoil pattern on this gun is particularly squirrely for a submachine gun so you really have to earn the great power numbers that this gun can provide. In tight quarters, this shouldn't be too much of a problem as you've got a nice big target to hit. However, if your target has any sort of cover beyond a close range, you may want to try out whatever other weapon you are holding.\n - Fire Rate\n\nJumping now to fire rates, it looks like this weapon again sits comfortably in the top tier of submachine guns in Verdansk. At the third highest fire rate, the combination of damage and fire rate seen here paints a profile of power that anyone can appreciate, particularly with great recoil control. As is typical of a submachine gun, the fire rate here allows for great competitiveness and recovery from missed shots in tight quarters so that you can keep playing your video game instead of staring at a loading screen.\n - Range\n\nWe'll say this as simply as we can. The Cold War MP5 does indeed struggle at range. True to form for a submachine gun, damage fall-off on this weapon really weakens it up once we start moving it out to farther ranges. In tight, this thing is a beast. However, the combination of recoil and damage fall-off for this gun make it a tough candidate for a mid-range fight.\n - Mobility\n\nChecking in with mobility aspects of this gun, it looks like things look pretty strong once again. The maximum strafe speed that can be created on this weapon with the right attachments puts it in the third position behind the PPSh-41 and the MAC-10. Overall, though the Cold War MP5 floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee typical of an MP5 that players have come to expect from a Call of Duty video game.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/mp5-cw-loady.png)\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nChecking around at our players' profiles, we do start to see some patterns, though. We'll mention it but you already know it: Agency Suppressor required. After that players clearly like to accentuate their strafe speed by attaching the Tiger Team Spotlight into their Laser slot. Again, seeking to up the ante on movement, players look like they are selecting the Raider Stock the most often and bringing in the Bruiser Grip to help them the most in the thick of battle. Last, as is typical of Warzone weaponry, players are increasing their magazine size by tacking on the STANAG 50 Rnd Drum. Put it all together and you have a really aggressive weapon that can deal high amounts of damage - and fast.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nWriting this article on the Cold War MP5 got us thinking one thing: This is a weapon that you'll need to practice with. However, once you get the hang of it, you will be rewarded. The recoil seen on this weapon is atypical compared to a great many submachine guns so it takes some getting used to when it comes to feeling out where this weapon is going to excel and when you will want to back off of your fight for a new angle. But, as we said, once you figure out how to play around with this weapon and really feel out its kinks, you end up with a pretty tasty reward.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: Krig 6",
    markdown:
      "\n# Weapon Spotlight: Krig 6\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we welcome the Krig 6 to the Verdansk stage! A late comer to the Season Four meta, the Krig 6 is proving itself as a top-flight contender for mid-range to long range options with a statistics profile that makes you believe that you're staring down the barrel of a beast. Once you take it out in game, though, you're really going to find out how much you love the Krig. And it has some pretty sweet blueprints, too!\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/krig-6.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nWhen the Krig 6 was first introduced to the Call of Duty Warzone scene, there was a pretty sizeable handful of players who wanted to pick it up and have it be a meta weapon. For most, though, they began to notice that they were losing too many mid to long range engagements that they were expecting to win. As it turned out, there were just too many other options that would outperform the Krig with its current characteristics.\n\nBut, hey, nothing a buff won't fix, right, developers!? Later into Season 4, the Krig 6 finally earned its spot in the meta when it received a buff that made it a much more viable candidate for winning gunfights and satisfying players. Now, the Krig is to the point that players have a choice to make about their playstyles to choose between the Krig and the C58 and make a selection from there.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nLucky for us, the unlock level for the Krig 6 is quite low. After playing for a truly minimal amount of time in either Call of Duty Warzone or Black Ops Cold War, players should have the weapon unlocked as they have reached Level 16 with their account for that season.\n\n## Break It Down\n - Damage\n\nChecking out damage statistics, the Krig looks like a somewhat middling Assault Rifle. For chest shots, it takes 8 shots to do away with our enemy in Warzone with a time to kill of 644. Moving up to head shots, we see that it takes 6 shots with a time to kill of 460 to earn a kill. Clearly, the Krig 6 rewards players for earning their way into headshots. Interestingly, moving past 40 meters, the Krig continues to show mostly average damage numbers with 9 shots to kill and a 736 time to kill for chest shots. But again, those headshots add up taking just 7 shots to kill to add up to a 552 time to kill at this same range.\n - Control\n\nThe recoil pattern on the Krig is where things really start to look interesting. With the right attachment setup (which you can find on our player profiles), this weapon can end up with almost zero recoil. Once you've figured out the setup, it can become extremely easy to shoot this weapon with how easy to control it is. This is a major boon for this gun as this allows you it to make up for those average-ish damage numbers that we were talking about before.\n - Fire Rate\n\nTaking a look at fire rate, the same story of average performance really rears its head again. Players will notice a perfectly average feeling and looking fire rate with a Krig. This fire rate is good enough to keep up damage output that is pretty run-of-the-mill while still giving you the ability to win a close range engagement under the right circumstances. Again, the Krig holds its own in the Assault Rifle category but doesn't outshine its competition.\n - Range\n\nThis is actually a spot where we really admire what the Krig can do. Even at long ranges, the Krig finds a way to maintain its lethality in such a way that players can enjoy more use cases for this otherwise middling weapon. At mid-range, the performance for this weapon is slightly above average for an Assault Rifle. However, getting into deeper ranges really showcases how the Krig can be a really nice option if you think you are going to be taking some long range fights but still want the fire rate of an Assault Rifle.\n - Mobility\n\nAs far as mobility goes, the Krig isn't the Assault Rifle to pick out if you are looking for a super strafe-y weapon. While the Krig's movement is still average for an AR, there are far better options to go with if you're looking for excellent movement like the FFAR, Groza, QBZ, or XM4.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/krig-loady.png)\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nLooking around at what players are using on kittr, things start off exactly as you'd expect. Agency Suppressor. Weird. With that out of the way, we move onto barrels where the best on the game are opting for one of two options: either the 19.7\" Ranger or the 15\" CMV Mil-Spec. These two barrels provide much different characteristics to the weapon so be sure to experiment with what you like better here. After that we're finding that the 3x Axial Arms is the optic of choice. Picking up a few extra rounds with the STANAG 60 Rnd magazine also appears to be a standard while the 5th and final option for the loadout seems to vary. Some players are going for an SFOD Speedgrip. Others opt for Serpent Wrap. Still more go for the Airborne Elastic Wrap as their final choice. As it turns out, with the Krig, the setup isn't as standardized as most other weapons.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nWith the Krig, things become quite preferential. Even just wanting to use it as your go-to Assault Rifle appears to be quite a fluid situation. Then, once you really do pick out that the Krig 6 is the weapon you want to be your primary in Verdansk, picking out the right attachments isn't a given. The ordinary performance of this weapon is not to be taken lightly, though, as the weapon can be crafted into a shape that you find best and, really, great aiming can turn this gun into a top performer.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: FARA 83",
    markdown:
      "# Weapon Spotlight: FARA 83\n\nVerdanskers, it's right about time to introduce the FARA 83 here on the blog. When it comes to Assault Rifles right now in Call of Duty Warzone, the FARA 83 is right there in the mix as a suitable option for a mid to long-range rifle that competes with the best of them. Let's take a deeper look into why the FARA is a great option for defending yourself in Verdansk to rack up some kills.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/fara-83.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nThe FARA 83 joined the lineup of weaponry that can be found in Warzone with the release of the Season Two Battle Pass after Cold War and Modern Warfare joined forces. When the FARA was introduced, there were many players who took a look at its stat line and really wanted the weapon to be take over the meta. Despite efforts by many high skill players, the FARA just couldn't seem to figure it's way into being the best Assault Rifle. Why? Because the AMAX was still living its best life.\n\nHowever, the AMAX didn't get suddenly nerfed out of dominance. When that happened, it was time for the FARA to shine. The FARA began to be the gun of choice when you looked at professional customs, casual gameplay, and everywhere in between. However, another weapon balance change brings us to today where the FARA has become more of a niche weapon rather than a can't miss, go-to weapon selection.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nUnlocking the FARA during Season 2 was as simple as reaching Tier 15 in the Battle Pass for that season. But now that Season 2 has ended, you can still get your hands on the FARA in another way. If you don't quite have the FARA unlocked today, you can earn it by scoring two headshot kills in 15 different matches. Start blasting away, fella!\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n\nIf you were to go off of just damage metrics, the FARA looks like an outstanding choice for wiping the floor with your enemies around Verdansk. Hint: it is. Using just 9 rounds, the FARA scores a time to kill of just 608 with chest shots. If you can manage some headshots, the FARA will use just 7 rounds to clear a time to kill of only 456! Wow!\n\n - Control\n\nControlling the FARA is actually a pleasant experience as well. The base weapon without any attachments was actually in floor loot during most of Season Two where players were most likely to become acquainted with the weapon. They found that the recoil on this weapon was plenty manageable even at mid to long ranges where you would expect floor loot to really struggle. What's more, with the right attachments, the FARA can have so little recoil that it almost feels effortless to control its recoil!\n\n - Fire Rate\n\nChecking in with the fire rate, the FARA actually shows off a quite impressive number here as well. The FARA achieves a fire rate that scores in the upper echelon of Assault Rifles, making it effective in nearly any situation. Facing off against the best submachine guns won't quite work at close ranges won't quite work (even with these good fire rates) - but we would still trust the FARA in a pinch.\n\n - Range\n\nRange is another spot where the FARA serves itself - and players who use it - well. Looking at the damage numbers for the FARA at range prove this fact as shots to the chest from more than 30 meters away result in a time to kill of 684 - which is awesome. For headshots at more than 30 meters, 8 rounds will result in a time to kill of just 532. So, when it comes to usage at range, this weapon holds its own - even on the deep ball.\n\n - Mobility\n\nThe mobility of the FARA is actually quite nice for an Assault Rifle. Its strafe speed is above average for the weapon category, making it a a weapon that you can still use while trying to play fast. However, as you go to create your setup using the attachments that are important to this weapon, you'll lose quite a bit of mobility. Because this is indeed an Assault Rifle and meant for more range-y encounters, this strafe speed is nice to keep if you can but not the end of the world to not have.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/fara-loady.png)\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nWith the FARA, it looks like it's pretty important to set your weapon up precisely how the pros use it. Of course, you're going to see a suppressor on an Assault Rifle so the Gru Suppressor is a given. Next, we move down to the barrel where nearly every player is using the 18.7\" Spetsnaz RPK Barrel. After that, the Axial Arms 3x is the standard for creating a nice view to hunt down enemies with. Next, it appears that the standard is the Spetsnaz 60 Rnd magazine is used by nearly all of our players. The last attachment slot for the FARA seems to be split between two different options. It looks like the lion's share of players go for the Spetsnaz Speedgrip for their underbarrel. However, does look like some players choose to opt for the Serpent Wrap on this weapon. So, it looks like you have some playing around to do.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nThe FARA 83 is a worthwhile candidate for use out in Verdansk as long as you are prepared to not be using a complete GOAT of a weapon. Right now, the FARA is being beaten by the likes of the Krig and the C58. But, if you want to mix up your gameplay and for a new look, the FARA is a plenty viable option that you can have fun with out in the Warzone. Let's get it done.",

    markdown:
      "# Player Spotlight: JoeWo\n\nkittr is ecstatic to open its doors to JoeWo as the latest player to use our platform!\n\nYou know him, you love him, you really want to be him: JoeWo. Joe's amazing personality shines through on his stream leading to an absolutely wonderful viewer experience. But let's not beat around the bush.\n\nThis man is an absolute savage in Verdansk. Known as \"The Movement King,\" Joe is at his best with a weapon in his hands that allows him to bounce around the map like a man possessed, racking up high kill games as easy going to get groceries. Let's dive into what we know about JoeWo and convince you that Joe is your new favorite player.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/joe-logo.jpg)\n\n## About\n\nBorn Joseph Wohala, this incredible player currently hails from North Carolina. While attending college at the University of North Carolina, Joe began playing video games on stream - and, oh man, did the crowd enjoy that. Joe quickly rose through the ranks of the Call of Duty: Warzone crowd amassing a great stream following where Joe maintains the highest of vibes at all times. Joe is also dog-father to an adorable Golden Doodle puppy that goes by the name of Bolt. Bolt loves to slide cancel just as much as his dog-father.\n\n## What's in a Name?\n\nWell, this one is simple: His name's Joe and \"woah\" sounds cool right after it. However, Joe's gaming moniker was not always so elementary.\n\nWhen Joe began his streaming career, he went by the name \"AverageJoeWo.\" This was, of course, a play on the phrase \"your daily average joe.\" As it turns out, though, the more Joe managed to grow his stream, the less he enjoyed going by this name. Which is understandable. Watch this man play. He's not average.\n\nSo, with his streaming visions already materializing, Joe made what most would call a risky move and attempted a name change. Thankfully, this change was subtle in that he simply dropped the \"average\" from his name to become what we all know and love him as: JoeWo.\n\n## Stream History\n\nJoeWo began his streaming career in May 2018.  According to his stream metrics, even with low view counts, Joe was committed to success by streaming for at least a view hours a day nearly every day. However, with the release of Warzone (and Joe's subsequent dominance in game), Joe's viewership quickly began to creep upwards.\n\nThese days, Joe's streams consistently to an average of 3,500 viewers with peaks up to 33,000 viewers. Joe typically streams every day where his thriving community enjoys streams from Joe's garage which has been fully decked out into a gaming/streaming/business studio.\n\n## Play Style\n\nWatching JoeWo play Warzone for even five minutes reveals the unique flavor of Call of Duty that he brings to the table. There is a clear and simple reason that he has earned the nickname \"The Movement King.\" His movement is absolutely incredible. As a fellow Warzone player, I genuinely have no concept of how to emulate the gameplay that JoeWo puts on every single day. Even when someone does manage to eliminate him, the way his character moves on the killcam is something to behold. So, all of that is to say: JoeWo's signature is his movement.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/joe.jpg)\n\n## Tournament Winnings\n\nNot only is JoeWo an exceptional content creator but his tournament winnings are marvelous, as well. In total, Joe has gone home with $107,183.34 in winnings across his tournament performances in Call of Duty Warzone. Not too shabby if you ask us.\n\nLet's look at some details on some of his top performances:\n\n - Atlanta Faze Gold Rush (1st Place)\n\nJoeWo won this tournament while duoing with fellow kittr rostermate Stukawaki on 5/5/2021. Now, for most tournaments, prize winnings are paid out in cash. But this tournament was a little different. Instead Joe came away with a real life gold bar worth $56,000. So, not only did he win a \"gold medal,\" he literally earned gold by winning this tournament.\n\n- Vikkstar's Warzone Showdown: Grand Finals (1st Place\n\nThis Vikkstar tournament lasted over the course of several weekends of qualifiers, finishing with a grand finals between all of those various weekend winners. With his teammate HusKerrs, Joe took home a total prize of $15,000 to split evenly. This tournament was largely regarded as a pretty wide open field that would reward the truly best duo at the time so winning this one is a serious accomplishment.\n- Vikkstar's Warzone Showdown 2: Week 3 (1st Place)\n\nHey, look, another edition of that sweet Vikkstar tournament! This time, however, Joe found himself playing with the likes of Stukawaki. Together, these two took home $12,000 to split at the end of Week 3, ultimately going on to have a really nice showing the finals of this second running of the Vikkstar Showdown.\n- Vikkstar's Warzone Showdown: Week 4 (1st Place)\n\nOkay, now we are headed back to the HusKerrs-JoeWo pairing! This is the weekend tournament in which Husk-Wo earned their qualifying spot in the Grand Finals. With an absolutely dominant showing in this tournament, JoeWo copped himself a $6,000 bag to take home to Bolt. At this time, this duo was largely regarded as the team to beat across much of Verdansk.",

      "# Ashley Shew\n\nWhile I am the programming side of things,  my sister Ashley has skills I had no idea she possessed on the design side. When we got together for my brother’s graduation and discussed the app, I could tell she could bring something to the table.\n\nI will be honest, I might not have always been exactly the most nurturing older brother. I am pretty sure I mostly said, “Can you make me cookies/pancakes/a sandwich?,” and “Get out of my room,” the most to her when we were growing up. She is a great cook. But as we’ve gotten older, w’re homies.  \n\nShe is just as competitive as I am (must be a family trait) and played travel volleyball through high school. She was good enough to play for Oregon State University who offered her a spot, but thankfully she opted not to play and had all this extra time for learning things - like gaming.\n\nI knew she played the occasional Wii and Xbox when we were young. But in college she started playing other games like Dead by Daylight and State of Decay 2, and went back to Toontown with the release of Rewritten. She never became too much of a first-person-shooter gamer but she knew what Twitch even was to my surprise.\n\nWhat I hadn't realized was that, in high school, she had taken a bunch of computer graphics classes. Seeing her general design vibe looking at her room decor, art, and clothes, I thought maybe she had a knack for this sort of thing. Even though I knew there would be a learning curve, I am not sure why I would be skeptical at all since she was a Presidential Scholar at OSU and picks things up pretty quick. But, you know, older brother stuff…\n\nAnyway, I had her work on a few designs for another project and wow, she’s a full on certified USDA Angus Beef all-star at web design. Not only does she learn the design program itself lightning quick, but her designs are on point. You agree with me, you’re the one using them today!\n\nJust as the days when I had to convince her to make me cookies, somehow I am pretty happy to say she agreed to design the kittr app with me - and it is even better than I could have imagined. She’s just better than me. I’ll happily say it: Outplayed. GGs.\n\nI’m more than thankful. I absolutely could not do this without her. If wasn’t for her, you guys wouldn’t have the beautiful User Dashboard and the lovely Kit Displayr that you guys know and love. Thanks, Ash.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: Mac-10",
    markdown:
      "\n# Weapon Spotlight: MAC-10\n\nSay hello to the kittr staff's favorite Warzone weapon! The MAC-10 has, for us, become a staple to this video game mode and we think this bad boy is perhaps one of the most fun weapons to use. When it came around time to write the article for this one, we could think of a great handful of personal clips to share around the office centered around this gun. For us, the MAC-10 is a 10 out of 10!\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/mac-10.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nRemember back in the day when Warzone only featured Modern Warfare gear? And then it merged with Cold War?! Wow, crazy times.\n\nWell, when that happened, we all saw the introduction of the MAC-10 to Warzone. Almost immediately players picked up on how outstanding the performance of this weapon really was and began incorporating it into their go-to daily weaponry. As a matter of fact, the weapon actually did receive a nerf mid-way through its life. But, still, it is a great weapon to this day.\n\nWhile the MAC-10 has only been in the game for less than a year, it feels like a marquee member and mainstay within the game. Looking back through patches, there are a few moments when you could point at the MAC-10 and say it wasn't a *true* meta weapon - but it was always darn close. And, what's more, those times were times when the MAC-10 was overshadowed by some vastly overpowered weapon. Accordingly, the MAC-10 sits today right in the meta mix in Warzone.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nThe MAC-10 could be unlocked by getting to Tier 15 of the first battle pass after Cold War and Warzone collided. \n\n## Break It Down\n - Damage\n\nJumping right into the damage portion of the program, we find that the MAC-10 actually looks like a pretty run-of-the-mill submachine option. With a time to kill sitting at 541 for chest shots and 486 for head shots, this gun really doesn't outshine the competition in this regard. Additionally, we see that it takes 11 shots to kill for chest shots and 10 shots to kill for head shots - and that's even just within 15 meters. Certainly, there are better options out there, right? Keep reading, friend.\n - Control\n\nAs far as control goes, the MAC-10 again gets outshined by other members of the submachine gun class once again. The submachine gun category on the whole has relatively little recoil due to the smaller bullet size, smaller weapon size, and close range use case of the class. However, speaking relative to the class, the MAC-10 has some more dramatic recoil than its siblings that, with a little practice, becomes plenty manageable at even deeper ranges.\n - Fire Rate\n\nNow here is where we want to talk about how good the MAC-10 is. Wow! The MAC-10 shoots at 1110 rounds per minute making it a clear-cut winner for the \"I Shoot the Fastest!!!\" crown in the Warzone lineup. This type of fire rate makes up for the damage and control shortcomings of the weapon by ensuring that, even if you miss a few shots, you'll be able to recover quickly with some mindful resetting of your aim.\n - Range\n\nThe range of this weapon is also quite admirable. While submachine guns are meant for close range engagements, the MAC actually performs quite admirably - even in a fight against an assault rifle at medium ranges. At mid-range, the fire rate of the MAC again takes it up to another level because of the sustained nature of the damage output of the weapon. Again, even if you manage to miss a few bullets (of course, you never would), the fire rate allows you to maintain some lethality to get you back into the fight.\n - Mobility\n\nWait, no, **THIS** is where want to talk about how amazing this gun really is! The mobility of the MAC-10, even by default, is extremely desirable for fast paced players that want to get in and out of engagements quickly. Dancing around corners, slide cancelling into a triple Scuf jump bunny hop, and closing gaps on wounded enemies are exactly where the MAC-10 shines. For us, this is where the fun for this weapon is as you can both put out great damage but still run around with some serious pace that'll make your momma weep.\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/mac-10-loady.png)\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nWe peeped around our roster for you, though, to give you a quick summary. Starting off at the muzzle, you're going to find the Agency Suppressor - no surprise there. For barrels, we're seeing almost always that our players are using the 5.9\" Task Force to get some nice shots downrange. It also seems pretty standard on our roster that the STANAG 53 Rnd Drum is going to be utilized. After that, two attachments come into play to really accentuate the already great mobility of the MAC. Our players usually put on a Tiger Team Spotlight for their laser, granting the weapon extra movement capabilities. After that, we see two different strategies. Some of our roster likes to attach(?) No Stock while the other half of our roster prefers to use the Raider Stock. Either way, these attachments are going to allow the gun to pick up even **more mobility gains**. We like those.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nWhen it comes to the Mac-10, there is a clear theme that keeps coming up. Speed, speed, speed. If powering around Verdansk as fast as you possibly can is your style, we offer you the MAC-10. You'll find success in your up-close-and-person encounters while still maintaining great mid-range ability to complement whatever it is that you're running for your longer range weapon. All told, we love the MAC-10 for its big mobility abilities all the while having some pretty vicious pop to lace up some enemy combatants.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: Kar98k",
    markdown:
      "# Weapon Spotlight: Kar98k\n\nFolks, we're back with another Weapon Spotlight to shine a light on what some may describe as a slightly controversial weapon in the Warzone space. While some find sniping in Call of Duty Warzone to be too easy for the lethality that it delivers, other find it to be a fun addition to the game that allows for a great change of piece from the automatic weapons that are so common to use in Verdansk. Either way, that makes this weapon worthy of a post so here we are.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/kar98k.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nThe Kar is practically an institution in the Warzone community. Because it has been a part of the game since the game's inception, the Kar98k has been dropping bodies since the beginning. Interestingly, the Kar is the only weapon (that we can think of right now, anyway) that has been a part of the Verdansk meta for 100% of the game's existence. To some, this weapon offers too much reward for too little risk or effort. \n\nBut, with that said, one thing has remained clear through the duration of Warzone's popularity: Game developers think that the Kar98k is balanced. Through so many waves of weapon buffs, nerfs, and rebalances, the Kar98k has gone untouched through it all. We think that speaks volumes about where this weapon stands as a member of the Warzone meta.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nTo unlock the Kar98k, a player must reach Account Level 33. While this isn't exactly an instant unlock like some other weapons with lower unlock levels, the Kar98 is worth the wait if you are a player who has enjoyed sniping in other Call of Duty games. Or even sniping in other games, in general!\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n\nThe damage of the Kar98k, while not the strongest in the sniper category, is great for its use case. While other snipers are clearly meant for standing on top of a roof and preying on longe range targets, the Kar98k actually has a profile that lends itself to being an assault rifle replacement. At super long, sniper-only ranges, the Kar98k can sometimes take three shots to kill. However, at ranges inside of 150-200m, the Kar can deliver two shot kills to the chest and stomach and one shot kills to the head. There is an odd thing that happens, though, with knocked enemies where the Kar will somehow take three shots to kill an already knocked enemy. So just make a mental note that can happen seemingly at random sometimes.\n\n - Bullet Velocity\n\nRather than talk about control, we talk about bullet velocity for snipers. In the case of the Kar98, bullet velocity is absolutely not best in class as far as snipers go. Looking at the rest of the characteristics for this weapon, though, this is to be expected. This sniper begs to be used as a run-and-gun (almost \"assault rifle-ish\") option that isn't meant for the deepest shots on the Verdansk map. This is not to say, though, that the muzzle velocity of this weapon is unmanageable, though. It make take some practice, particularly on targets that are moving across your view, but you can hit some great shots using the Kar.\n\n - Fire Rate\n\nFire rates are obviously slower than other weapon types when it comes to sniper rifles - but it still matters a ton when you're talking about lacing up targets downrange! The Kar is a bolt action rifle so you will need to reset your bolt every time you take a shot. However, this action doesn't take too much time and allows for you to recover from your previous shot (and reset mentally, in our opinion). \n\nThe only time you're not going to be happy with the Kar is when you need to reload. Each round has to be loaded one-by-one, making a full reload back to 5 shots take a sometimes painful amount of time. This can be mitigated, though, by interrupting the reload with a weapon switch so you can go back to putting rounds downrange with what you've got reloaded.\n\n - Range\n\nThe range of the Kar98k is actually an interesting topic. Depending on who you talk to, you'll get different answers. Some will tell you that the range on the Kar is terrible. However, we think that this answer is coming from people who don't quite understand that this weapon is meant for running-and-gunning rather than for rooftop hawkeye-ing. At nearly every reasonable range in Verdansk, the Kar nets a kill in two shots to the body and one shot to the head.\n\n - Mobility\n\nHere's where things get fun with the Kar98. For most snipers, mobility isn't really much of a concern. The plan is to stand on a rooftop and hit something really, really far away. However, with the Kar, mobility is **crazy high for a sniper**. You can Scuf jump, double bunny hop, and slide cancel your way around with the Kar and scope in on targets quickly like any other sniper will not be able to. \n\n![enter image description here](/blog/kar-loady.png)\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nBuilding up the Kar98k, 3 out of the 5 attachments that players use are practically universal. Monolithic Suppressor, Sniper Scope, and and Tac Laser (for super fast aiming down sights) all are pretty much must-haves. Barrels can vary depending on what style of Kar you are going to be going for. Basically, the earliest unlocked barrel has the worst range but the best movement while the last barrel has the best range but the worst movement. In our opinion, we're going with the last barrel, though, because the movement is still great even with it. Last, players are choosing between using the FTAC Sport Comb or Stippled Grip. Both provide aim down sights gains but have other more nuanced advantages.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nTo bring up the Kar98k is to start a discussion on the state of sniping in Warzone. Some players love it, some players hate it. We think it's fun - but we definitely understand the other side where it's annoying to get one-shotted across the map. With enough skill and practice, a player can complete dominate an entire quadrant of a map with a Kar98k. Love it or hate it, the Kar is a mainstay of the meta in Warzone and a top weapon in its class.",

    markdown:
      "\n# Player Spotlight: Almxnd\n\nkittr welcomes Almxnd to the roster!\n\nWe're so excited have on perhaps the most prolific Call of Duty Warzone player to date, Mr. Almxnd himself! This man has been absolutely tearing up the Warzone scene ever since he and Tommey duo'ed up to create a dynamic pairing that has won a ton of money of the course of the past six months. Let's do an all-around for Almxnd and make sure that we turn him into your new favorite player.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/almond-logo.png)\n\n## About\n\nBy birth, Almxnd's name is actually Ben. And, truthfully, everyone around Almxnd from his teammates to his gaming friends to his chat usually does call him Ben. As a member of the Minnesota ROKKR organization, Almxnd has proven himself as both a content creator and a competitive player. Not much else is known about Almxnd - but we're willing to bet that this low-key personality wants to keep it that way.\n\n## What's in a Name?\n\nAccording to the !name command in Almxnd's Twitch stream chat, the origin of this nut based name is pretty simple. Back in the days of XBOX 360, you could end up with a randomly generated name that was an adjective, a noun, and a number. For Ben, apparently he was assigned \"CaramelAlmond12.\" As he continued to game, the name grew onto him and he has used it ever since.\n\n## Stream History\n\nChecking back on Almxnd's stream history, it looks like his first Twitch Stream occurred way back in March of 2018 and, for quite some time, his audience was intermittent at best. However, after nearly two years, somewhere in the middle part of 2020 Almxnd began to see his viewership grow. With intermittent and dramatic spikes, his viewership hung in the hundreds - until 2021. As we'll cover later, the competitive Warzone scene started to pay dividends for Almxnd, both directly in monetary winnings and in the form of stream growth. Today, Almxnd draws a strong and consistent crowd that marvels at his play around Verdansk.\n\n## Play Style\n\nAlmxnd's play style is extremely unique in that it is completely about taking great reads, applying great aim, and dicing up full teams of four without even having his plates ripped off almost all of the time. While Ben possesses extraordinary aiming ability, his gameplay is really marked by a fascinating ability to understand his surroundings, where enemy players are, where enemy players *are going to go*, and how he can take of advantage of every minute detail about the game. Whether it be understanding how to use a Semtex at a key moment to completely turn the tide of a battle or repositioning at the exactly right moment, Almxnd can almost always be counted on to make high percentage plays.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/almond.jpg)\n\n## Tournament Winnings\n\nThrough the course of 2020 and 2021, it has almost been easier to find Almxnd in first place at the end of a tourney than not. To put a number to it, Ben has won 29 of the 59 tournaments that we could find that he has participated in. **That is dominance.**\n\nLet's look at some details on some of his top performances:\n\n - JGOD's Call of Duty Warzone Tournament (1st Place)\n\nOn 6/26/2021, with his duo Tommey, Almxnd took home top honors in a star-studded lineup that included all of the top pros in Warzone. At the end of this tourney which featured a $40,000 prize pool, the duo brought home a purse of $10,000. All in a day's work for this pair.\n\n- Atlanta FaZe UMG Champions Warzone Series 2021 (1st Place)\n\nHey, look it's Tommey and Almxnd winning again! Be prepared to hear more of that as you keep reading. In this tournament, a $25,000 prize pool netted this winning duo $7,500 on 6/25/2021. An astute reader would notice that that is literally the day before the JGOD tourney we mentioned above! Okay, then all in TWO day's work for this duo.\n\n- Jack Link's Warzone Invitational (Week 2) (1st Place)\n\nThis beef jerky based brawl featured some seriously deep talent throughout the field - but here we find Almxnd on top with his teammate, Tommey, once again. The prize pool for this weekend tourney amounted to $30,000, leaving $7,500 for Almxnd and Tommey to snag as the winner's of this tournament.\n\n- Jack Link's Warzone Invitational (Week 3) (1st Place)\n\nWow, these guys must really love beef jerky! Or, maybe they just like Warzone and are really good at it. You decide. Similar to the week prior, Tommey and Almxnd obliterated the competition to earn themselves a purse of $7,500 to split between the two of them. I wonder if they bought any Jack Link's beef jerky with some of these winnings.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: XM4",
    markdown:
      "\n# Weapon Spotlight: XM4\n\nYou are probably well acquainted with the M4 as a tried and true weapon throughout the history of Call of Duty. Buuuut have ya met the XM4?! This Assault Rifle is an extremely interesting Warzone option from the Cold War lineup. While the XM4 might not be the deadliest weapon in Verdansk right now, it is most certainly a perfectly viable option in the hands of a talented player.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/xm4.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nThe XM4 made it into Verdansk by way of the collisions between Cold War and Modern Warfare. At that time, the meta had gotten thrown for a loop as a completely brand new set of had just entered the equation. As the meta began to emerge, many players began to opt for the XM4 as a submachine gun rather than a a rangier weapon that one would expect from an Assault Rifle.\n\nIt took quite a minute for players to figure out how they wanted to set up their XM4's, though. Different ways of setting up the XM4 were seen all across different play styles as the XM4 continually tried to find a place as a dominant weapon in a certain use case as many weapons do in Warzone. However, the XM4 continued to prove itself time and time again as a great all-arounder that could get used in many different ways around Verdansk.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nHey, look, it's a freebie! The XM4 is available just by turning the game on. Can't argue with that! You will still have to unlock all of the attachments that you desire - but at least you have a great base to start with.\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n\nLet's dive right in. The damage on the XM4 is, while not the best in the game, still exquisite. Time to kills for the XM4 look like 666 for shots to the chest and 416 for shots to the head. Quite a nice reward for rocking the melon! It's also worthy of note that 9 shots will earn a kill into the chest while 6 shots will lay your enemy down if they are to the head. Comparing against other assault rifles, this damage profile is more than worthy of earning the XM4 its way into a few of your loadouts.\n\n - Control\n\nAs far as controlling the recoil on the XM4 goes, this is where things can start to get a little dicey. We want to start this off by saying that the recoil pattern on the XM4 is plenty manageable, especially with the right attachments. However, it is quite different compared to most other weapons. The XM4 has an extremely twitchy, side-to-side, back-and-forth sort of pattern that can be jarring at first. However, once you get used to the initial oddities of this recoil, you'll find that you can control this weapon quite easily.\n\n - Fire Rate\n\nThe fire rate for the XM4 is nothing exceptional but also doesn't leave anything to be desired. The rounds per minute is high enough that a player can expect more than reasonable damage output but not so ridiculous that the gun starts to feel like a submachine gun. Additionally, the fire rate is fast enough to let a player recover from errors in aiming quickly enough that they should be able to still manage a kill if they fall behind in their gunfight.\n\n - Range\n\nThe range of the XM4 can be somewhat questionable at times. Because of the awkwardness of the recoil, it can be difficult to impossible to hit shots at range with this weapon. Attachments can be assigned that mitigate this recoil effect, certainly. However, these attachments then dumb down the true strengths of this gun as a high-mobility, short range gunner. When it comes to the XM4 at ranges beyond 50m, you're mostly taking your chances on whether or not you're going to be able to get what you want done.\n\n - Mobility\n\nHere is where the XM4 truly makes itself known as a great option for close range encounters. The XM4 has impeccable mobility for an assault rifle such that it almost feels like a submachine gun at times. With such a high mobility rating, the XM4 can be a really fun choice for ripping around those tight quarters engagements. The rest of this gun's profile makes for a  nice contender for a switch-up from your usual submachine gun of choice.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/xm4-loady.png)\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using. \n\nTrue to the submachine gunning ways of the XM4, the players of the kittr roster set up their weapon for short range encounters. First, the Agency Suppressor of course needs to be applied. After that, we're seeing the Tiger Team Spotlight as pretty much a given for nearly every player. After that, we usually see the STANAG 60 RND magazine being used although some players opt for the 45 round magazine. As far as barrels go, the 13.7\" Extended seems to be the choice for most of our players and the stock of choice appears to be the Raider Pad. Altogether, all of these attachments serve to make the mobility of this weapon even better while helping to bring the patchy recoil of the weapon back down to Earth.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nThe XM4 is fun. We're just going to put it that way. For some players, they'll have a hard time seeing through the iron sights of this gun so a Red Dot Sight will be needed. However, once you've got your setup figured out, the mobility of the XM4 along with its damage output capabilities make it an extremely entertaining option for running around in Verdansk like a maniac. With the XM4 vying for putting your favorite submachine gun out of commission, will you end up making a switch?",

      "\n# Tourney Wrap: $10,000 Dreamhack Beyond Proving Grounds\n\nCompetition time, baby! On 7/31/2021, a star studded cast of competitive Warzone gamers played an absolute marathon of a tournament that ended up having perhaps one of the most exciting finishes in all of competitive Warzone. Let's get around to this summary to find out just what happened!\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/beyond.jpg)\n\n## Surveying the Field\n\n32 teams of high powered Call of Duty offense made up this tournament field.

This tournament featured a Loser's Bracket, 1 tech error reset per team per game, hacker resets as approved by event staff, and **sweet, sweet sabotage enabled**.\n\n## Moving Through The Bracket\n\nGoing over the bracket, we see plenty of familiar names. HusKerrs & newbz made a deep run into the Winner's Bracket and were eliminated from the tourney in Round 5 of the Loser's Bracket. Mayappo and Ottereyes could be found in the semi-finals of the Winner's Bracket. Intechs & zColorss made a great run all the way up to Round 3 of the Loser's Bracket and JerKy26 & Scummn also found their way into Round 4 of the Loser's Bracket. fifkillvizualz & itzwarsz also could be found deep into the tournament, only being eliminated by Mayappo & Ottereyes in Round 6 of the Loser's Bracket. But after much sound and fury, only two teams remained at the end of it all...\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/warzone-1.jpg)\n\n## Finals Recap\n\nEnter Flxnked & Skullface49 from the Winner's Bracket and Tommey & Almxnd coming up from the Loser's Bracket.\n\nIn this format, coming in from the Winner's Bracket carries the significant advantage of only needing to win one Best of 3 series. However, coming in from the lower Loser's Bracket means that you are facing an undefeated team - who needs to be disposed of by winning two straight series. Let's dive into Verdansk to find out how this marathon tourney ended with an exciting finish.\n\n- Game 1, Series 1\n\nOn drop, we find our players diving around trying to snatch up helicopters around the Verdansk map for maximum mobility. Tommey experience an early death at Military Base that made his instincts say \"uh oh, that's a hacker.\" At this point, he contacted event staff with his \"hacker clip\" and let the admins deliberate over the death. While all of this was going on, at the close of Zone 1, scores were Skullface49 with 8, Flxnked with 9, Tommey with 3, and Almxnd with 4.\n\nSoon after, Almxnd was sniped while standing on top of the large, blue warehouse at port - but quickly dispensed of his Gulag opponent in a Stoner matchup. After re-landing on the map at Promenade, Almxnd once again found himself another awkward position where he ended up being on the lesser end of a Gallo and found himself in Spectator Mode.\n\nIn the meantime, Skullface49 and Flxnked were spending time racking up kills and building an early lead with Skullface finding players in the hills above hospital and Flxnked cruising around Promenade picking some fights. Tommey managed to buy back Almxnd after a moment and the pair found themselves bopping around Verdansk in a helicopter once again.\n\nAs Skullface and Flxnked's lead continued to grow, they took a moment to pump each other up, noticing their 9 kill lead. Tommey found himself in Farmland picking a battle with a full team of four - who ended up eliminating him after Tommey managed to pick up a few kills from their squad.\n\nWith the game starting to look like a runaway win for Skullface and Flxnked, the pair noticed two teams of four fighting at Stadium and quickly made their way that direction to find some more kills.\n\nHowever, things came to an abrupt halt as event staff notified all competitors that Tommey's first death had been ruled as a hacking situation. To the chagrin of Skullface and Flxnked, this Verdansk map was being reset to a 5-4 lead for Tommey and Almxnd.\n\n- Game 1 Reset, Series 1\n\nWith scores reset, the competitors found themselves back in the plane. Skullface49, Flxnked, and Almxnd dashed for a helicopter race at the \"Ground War\" building near Hangars - with Almxnd coming out in the driver's seat of the chopper. No quick kills were had by either team as Almxnd couldn't find anyone to chop up with his helicopter blades nor did Skullface and Flxnked find anyone to fight in Ground War.\n\nEventually, the first kill of the game was found by Skullface in the Police Station below Airport. Skullface49 and Flxnked again started off nicely as Skullface moved to Superstore to grab some kills and Flxnked won a sketchy 3v1 in what the comp players call \"Wager Houses\" near TV Station.\n\nAround this time, Tommey ended up in the Gulag (where he shortly won) and Almxnd had somehow gone on a streak to snag a 10 kill total. Tommey and Almxnd quickly bought a Loadout Box at Factory - where Tommey promptly died once again. Meanwhile, Flxnked also found himself on the losing end of a gunfight and was sent to Gulag where he won a Crossbow duel. At this point, Skullface had just finished a team in the SOS buildings to put them only down by two kills total.\n\nFlxnked, at this time, made a very smart move seeing Tommey in a battle with a full squad at Police Department in Airport. He snuck in a few moments after Tommey found himself in the thick of it with the opposing squad - where he was overwhelmed after a few moments. At this point, Flxnked rifled in to scoop up three of the four kills to close the gap and tie the game for the time being.\n\nBoth teams worked hard through the mid-game to gain an advantage - but the game was too close to call, even in the final moments. Eventually, both Skullface and Almxnd ended up on top of Train Station - but Almxnd got the best of these moments as he managed to slay out and earn his team a lead in the closing moments of the game.\n\nAt the end of Game 1, the score ended up Skullface49 with 24 kills, Flxnked with 10, Almxnd with 27, and Tommey with 19. That's a W for Tommey & Almxnd\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/red-smoke.jpg)\n\n- Game 2, Series 1\n\nTwo heli races to start this one off! Flxnked beat Tommey to the chopper at Boneyard and Almxnd won the race to the Hospital heli, splitting the two races. However, shortly after, Skullface, standing on top of the shorter Hospital buildings, managed to pick up a Stoner and destroy Almxnd's heli while it was sitting on top of the tallest Hospital building unmanned! High IQ!\n\nFlxnked ended up the first player to visit the Gulag but quickly won a QBZ shootout to land back on the helicopter that he was still managing. Almxnd shortly after won a QBZ gulag of his own. Meanwhile, Tommey chased two players through a red door - and got killed for his greed. At the same time, on top of train, Skullface got gunned by an extremely high skill player that he was simply not expecting to have it like that.\n\nMoving through the game, we find Tommey and Almxnd on top of Superstore together snatching up kills in every direction. Skullface and Flxnked also were picking up kills as they made their way through Boneyard. At the close of Zone 2, scores were Skullface: 4, Flxnked: 9, Almxnd: 12, Tommey: 11.\n\nEventually, Almxnd and Tommey found themselves with a 13 kill lead. Almxnd made several outstanding plays in a row to wipe a team in the apartment building to the south of Superstore while Skullface aggressively dove back onto a team that had just killed them - and wiped them clean. Skullface and Flxnked turned into killing machines on the top of Promenade but, unfortunately for them, it did not turn out to be enough to close a then 10 kill gap by the end of the game.\n\nAt the end of Game 2, the score was Skull: 19, Flxnked: 22, Almxnd: 28, Tommey: 27. That makes a map and series win for Tommey & Almxnd, forcing a brand new series for all the marbles.\n\n- Game 1, Series 2\n\nAnother helicopter race to the Boneyard spawn netted Flxnked a win over Tommey. The tide of war continued to turn against Tommey and Almxnd as Almxnd found himself in the Gulag almost immediately after landing. Skullface and Flxnked, both in helicopters at Hangars, threw a Loadout Box on top of a Hangar to grab their kits. In the meantime, Almxnd was returning from his Gulag and tried to steal the helicopter from Skullface. Unfortunately, though, he broke his ankles and died on the spot.\n\nAfter a regain, everyone was back up and playing. Almxnd and Flxnked found themselves in the SOS buildings together - but Almxnd got the better of the situation wiping two teams - by himself. After Zone 1 scores were 16 for Skullface & Flxnked and 18 for Tommey & Almxnd.\n\nAfter a handful of kills for Skullface & Flxnked, though, the lead had changed. Abruptly, both Tommey and Almxnd died, too! Game win for Skullface & Flxnked! Series advantage, Skullface & Flxnked!\n\n- Game 2, Series 2\n\nWith a possible closeout in their grasp, Skullface and Flxnked came out hot. Flxnked won the chopper race at Hospital and found his way into chopping up three enemies before every putting a foot down on the Verdansk map. Additionally, Skullface was cruising around Hangers with a helicopter of his own, padding his stats. At the close of Zone 1, Skullface and Flxnked were up 9 kills!\n\nThing began to look even worse for the prolific Tommey and Almxnd duo as both ended up in Gulag shortly into Zone 2. Though they won, Skullface beat a bounty for a kill or two, while Flxnked snuck out 3 kills on a team that was piled into a Cargo Truck. The last member of the team did manage to get the best of Flxnked though, sending him to Gulag where he promptly won a Ballistics Knife matchup.\n\nBy the end of Zone 3, we saw Skullface with 24 kills, Flxnked with 16, Tommey with 12, and Almxnd with 20. Flxnked, at this point, took a hard row by dying three tops nearly in succession, really dropping time when both he and his teammate could both be collecting kills. Somehow, with Zone 5 closing on the bottom corner of Bonyeard and the open fields beneath it, Tommey and Almxnd had closed what was once a double digit margin to just a deficit of two kills!\n\nWith the score tightened up, both teams found themselves duking it out with respective full teams. Tommey died, Almxnd finished up the crew they were battling, and Skullface & Flxnked got away from their battle cleanly. A quick score check...It's tied! And there's one enemy player left on the map!\n\nSkullface & Flxnked, quickly realizing that they just needed this one kill to win the tournament, split up to try to find this last man out in the open. Almxnd raced around for high ground in the hills to try to get a better vantage point. Suddenly, Flxnked nearly runs into the player headfirst and takes him down! \n\nMap win Skullface/Flxnked! Series win Skullface/Flxnked! Tournament win Skullface/Flxnked!\n\nThese two played an outstanding tournament together and we wouldn't be surprised to see them win more finals games. Taking home $4,000 for the top spot, these two are sure to be feeling good. The runner-up duo, Tommey and Almxnd, also took home some cash to the tune of $2,500.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/dreamhack.jpg)",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: Bullfrog",
    markdown:
      "\n\n# Weapon Spotlight: Bullfrog\n\nDid you know that there are only two animals on the Verdansk map? Can you name them?\n\nCorrect, the first animal is the one that you have that is an enemy flying in like eleven times. A seagull! Some think they provide nice ambience and realism. Some say they are just annoying.\n\nEqually as controversial is the second animal in the Warzone lineup. The Bullfrog. Some believe it to be an excellent weapon that is fit for daily use. Some will give it one try and never touch it again.\n\nEither way, the Bullfrog deserves an article so let's hop in.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/bullfrog.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nThe Bullfrog is one of the newer additions to the Warzone game mode as it made its way into the game through the Cold War/Warzone mashup. As there were so many guns vying for attention at that time, the Bullfrog did not see much early usage in the Warzone meta.\n\nA subsequent buff saw the Bullfrog rise in usage. Still, many players felt the early hangover effects of the \"Bullfrog too weak\" idea and the Bullfrog continued to be a weapon that had a cult-like following.\n\nThen, something really weird happened. The Bullfrog experienced a rebalance a few patches ago that...well, no one can really make sense of. The overall damage for the weapon was brought downwards two points while the range was improved by 11%. Additionally its strafe speed was slightly improved - but not by much. Again, the Bullfrog found itself in a really odd spot as some considered this rebalancing to be a buff while others thought of this move as a nerf.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nIn order for the Bullfrog to end up in your hands as a part of a loadout, all that you have to do is reach Level 43 on your player account. With a little bit of a play time to learn the ropes of the game, you'll end up gallivanting around Verdansk with your new amphibious friend in no time.\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n \nJumping around to look at damage numbers of different Warzone submachine guns, a pretty bleak picture gets painted for the Bullfrog. Sitting at a 639 time to kill using 9 bullets for shots to the chest to earn a kill, this puts the weapon outside of what most players would consider \"meta' worthiness. There are definitely several other SMGs that are much better in this department. However, for headshots, the Bullfrog sits at a much more attractive 399 time to kill using just 6 bullets. So, the reward for headshots with this weapon is HUGE.\n\n - Control\n \nControlling the Bullfrog isn't too much to complain about at all. Up close like a submachine gun is meant to be used, the recoil of the Bullfrog shouldn't be any problem for even an inexperienced player to handle. At moderate ranges, though, the Bullfrog's recoil pattern becomes a little more pronounced and could be cause for missing a few shots, costing a player their life.\n\n - Fire Rate\n \nThe fire rate is seriously slow for a submachine gun as far as the Bullfrog goes. The fire rate, among SMGS, of this weapon actually makes it second worst in this category, only besting the AK74u. Because of this, players must plan accordingly when they take their shots. Missing any shots with this gun could be a death sentence as your time to kill will increase wildly for every bullet that gets missed.\n\n - Range\n \nThe range of the Bullfrog is actually quite interesting. The recoil of the weapon is more than manageable, making this weapon viable at the furthest acceptable ranges for an SMG - sometimes even further depending on how good your aim can be. As we mentioned earlier, the most recent rebalance of the Bullfrog included a buff to the weapon's stat metrics, further enhancing this weapon's abilities.\n\n - Mobility\n \nThe mobility of the Bullfrog is really where it makes its money. Players who enjoy the Bullfrog point to its nearly best-in-class strafe speed as a serious strong suit of this weapon - and for good reason. The Bullfrog is tied for the second best movement in the game among SMGs, making it a serious contender for a daily driver as a secondary.\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/bullfrog-loady.png)\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using.\n\nClasses and kits for the Bullfrog appear to be a pretty uniform bunch. Of course, this is Warzone so we need to strap on a suppressor so we'll put on the GRU Suppressor first. Next, we'll move to the barrel where the whole of our players are utilizing the 7.4\" Task Force to get the most out of this weapon. Next, a Tiger Team Spotlight is brought into the mix to maximize the mobility of the weapon, accentuating what most players are looking forward to the most out of their Bullfrog. The stock here furthers that goal through the use of the Spetsnaz PKM Stock. Last, the Bruiser Grip is brought in to complete the build. There you have it - the Bullfrog build of the pros!\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nAltogether, the Bullfrog is a sort of awkward weapon. Many have never really given the weapon a chance because of the performance of the weapon when it was first introduced to the loot pool. For many of those players, the Bullfrog just never really got a buff so dramatic that it deserved their love and affection. However, for those who have tried the gun and really gotten used to it, it has become a serious option for a daily driver that performs well in all sorts of situations. Ribbit.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: AK-47 (CW)",
    markdown:
      "\n\n# Weapon Spotlight: AK-47 (CW)\n\nYou know it, you love it, it's the AK-47. While the AK-47 has been a part of Warzone for quite some time now, that was the Modern Warfare version of things. Now, it is time for the AK-47 to make a return - Cold War style. Known as a weapon that can pack a brilliant punch across many different Call of Duty Titles (and even other games and series), this weapon carries its legacy forward through Verdansk as a highly desirable option for doing big damage in the hands of a capable player.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/ak-47-cw.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nThe Cold War AK-47 joined the Warzone lineup through the crash landing of the Cold War weaponry straight into Verdansk. Along with many other viable options, the AK found its way into ground loot early in the Cold War cycle. The AK that players would find off of their drops featured a Sniper Scope, among other less notable attachments, making it extremely hard to control at even the slightest of ranges given that the AK-47 has notably high vertical recoil. Because of this combination, many players got a very bad taste of what the AK-47 is like as a range weapon and wrote the gun off entirely as unusable.\n\nHowever, lately, the CW AK-47 has begun to see a rise in popularity that is entirely different from these initial impressions. Most players are finding that the AK shines in situations where they weren't originally using it in that ground loot niche. Rather, when built correctly, the CW AK proves that it is a really formidable option as a close range gun to completely lay out enemy combatants in no time flat.\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nUnlocking the Cold War AK-47 is about as easy as playing the game. Actually - well, it really is that easy. The CW AK is unlocked at Player Level 7, meaning that even playing one match of Warzone should get you the CW AK - unless you die within 5 minutes of landing and lose your gulag.\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n \nAs with an AK-47 in most games, the damage of the CW AK is what makes it a stand out performer. The time to kill for shots to the chest is 600 using just 7 bullets. For headshots, the time to kill for this weapon is just 400 and only takes 5 rounds. Now, that sounds pretty good for an Assault Rifle, doesn't it? The even crazier part is that that competes with many of the submachine guns in the Warzone lineup. So, as always, the damage output of the AK-47 is great.\n\n - Control\n \nAgain, the CW AK-47 is in line with what one would expect out of an AK-47 in a video game. The massive damage output of this beast is mitigated by the recoil that it has to bring it back down to Earth. The CW AK has rather dramatic vertical recoil such that it is extremely difficult to control at most ranges, particularly if your target has nice cover. However, this recoil shouldn't prevent you from using this weapon inside of 20 meters - which is where you'll see most pros using this weapon.\n\n - Fire Rate\n \nHere is a difficulty with the AK that many players have. It's fire rate is just really slow. So, when you are in a close quarters situation with this weapon, you quite honestly must hit every shot that you try for - which can be difficult given the recoil pattern. Missing even one shot can be the difference between winning and losing your gunfight since every round carries such a high damage potential - even though the next round won't be coming any time soon in terms of fire rates.\n\n - Range\n \nThe range as far as the damage output of the CW AK-47 is righteous. The AK carries its strength even at the furthest of ranges across Verdansk. However, the problem here goes back to the recoil patterning of this weapon. At range, the vertical recoil that a player will experience could make this gun difficult to use if they aren't a high skill player. However, given enough practice, this AK can be used at even the longest ranges.\n\n - Mobility\n \nThe mobility on the CW AK doesn't exactly speak to its close quarters brethren. Rightfully. most other close range guns are of the \"submachine\" variety. This means that they are going to be high mobility - which the CW AK does not possess much of. However, with the right attachments, a player can shore up this drawback to make it so that the gun has decent mobility enough to compete with an SMG.\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/cw-ak-loady.png)\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using.\n\nTo create their close-range weapon, most of our pros are going with a pretty exacted approach and attachment setup for the CW AK. First, they are putting on the Suppressor at the muzzle. Notice that this isn't the GRU Suppressor like you'll see on nearly ever other Assault Rifle because the Suppressor is better for aim down sight time! Next, we see the Tiger Team Spotlight in the Laser slot and the Underbarrel being assigned as the Bruiser Grip. To get in more shots, the 45 Rnd is always use in the Ammunition slot. Last, our players use the KGB Skeletal Stock to pronounce this weapon's mobility statistics and give it some extra wiggle. There, you've got your brand new close quarters CW AK!\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nFor most games, using an AK-47 up close is a death sentence. You're probably not going to even think about it nor try it. However, here in Warzone, we go crazy. The CW AK-47 is a great option for those fights that are up close and personal if you are confident with your shot and want to use something that hits like a freight train. Now, use the loadout we told you, load up the game, and start slaying!",

    markdown:
      "# Player Spotlight: newbz\n\nkittr welcomes newbz to the roster!\n\nnewbz was one of the first two players to EVER use kittr for creating and editing loadouts to share with his viewers. When he joined we were ECSTATIC as a couple of us here on stuff love newbz, his stream, and his community. Here, let's run through a quick article about him so that you can have a new favorite player, too.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/newbz-logo.jpg)\n\n## About\n\nBorn Edy Juan, newbz is an American streamer currently residing in his home country. In the past three years, newbz has bounced around between a number of different gaming organizations including OutCold Gaming, MHP Esports, Mazer Gaming, J4L Org, and Team Divine. Most recently, he was a part of Sicario Gaming but his contract with them has since lapsed, making newbz a free agent.\n\n## What's in a Name?\n\nWell, as far as the \"newbz\" name goes, we don't have much to go on dipping back into Edy's history. In his early days, newbz used the name \"YRNewbZ\" on XBox Live. He also could be found using the name \"TBE_Newbzz\" on Playstation Network (and this is still his name on Twitter). It would seem that newbz continued the main part of his moniker up until today, refining things to how we know and love him: newbz.\n\nLet it be known, though: Most of newbz's community tends to call him Edy. From his friends to his mods to his chat, he will typically go by Ed or Edy.\n\n## Stream History\n\nChecking back through the history of newbz's Twitch stream, we see a long history of grinding that has now paid off. Since July 2017, newbz has been streaming to concurrent audiences of about 30 to 50 viewers with some moderate consistency. However, during 2020, it would appear that his stream exploded with the popularity of Warzone. Combining the fact that viewership for Warzone is huge and that newbz is really good at the game, this was only a matter of time.\n\n## Play Style\n\nProfiling newbz's play style is as simple as this: aim, aim, aim. newbz isn't typically the flashiest player you are going to see whipping around Verdansk. That's not to say that he won't make some of the most absurdly good plays that you have ever seen (he will), though. But it is to say that he is a particularly excellent shot with any weapon that he picks up. He's a dangerous man, folks, even if he is holding the highest recoil floor loot you can name.\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/newbz.png)\n\n## Tournament Winnings\n\nOver the course of the past year, newbz has won a number of large tournaments that have netted him a nice purse. Over the course of 48 tournaments, he has won $127,500 per data from esportsearnings.com.\n\nLet's look at some details on some of his top performances:\n\n - Nadeshot Warzone Invitational: 1st Place\n\nAt the beginning of the Warzone competitive scene, the duo to beat was very clearly HusKerrs and newbz. These two dominated the scene including a gigantic win in the Nadeshot Warzone Inivitional. On 5/18/2021, this duo scooped up $17,000 as their prize for coming in first place in a totally star-studded field that could have been anyone's game.\n- NYSL WarzoneMania\n\nOn 12/19/2021, newbz could be found teaming up with DougIsRaw and TeePee in a tournament put on by New York Subliners themselves. This trios tournament featured huge names from all across Verdansk and the competitive Call of Duty: Warzone lineup but, ultimately, they were all bested by newbz and company. Earning $50,000, this trio went home happy taking the top prize for the day.\n- Hugo Crypto Race\n\nWe don't see many of these on the Warzone scene but here it is: a solos tournament. Ah, and another thing you don't see too often: cryptocurrency for a prize? Even with the oddities, of this tournament, newbz came out as the leader of the pack, earning himself $10,000 worth of crypto monies. Other notable names were also found on the podium with Almond taking second place and Destroy placing third.",

    title: "Weapon Spotlight: PPSh-41",
    markdown:
      "\n\n\n# Weapon Spotlight: PPSh-41\n\nDuring this Season 4 run, there has been a TON of discussion about choices for secondary weapons (and quite enough about primary weapons, too). In the midst of all of this chatter, the PPSh-41 (or PPSh, for short) found its way into the mix as an absolute favorite of some players - but also a totally hated choice by others. No matter where you stand on the PPSh, it is still more than deserving of a place in the meta as something you are either killing or getting killed with.\n\n![enter image description here](/media/games/warzone/weapons/ppsh-41.png)\n\n##  First, some quick history.\n\nAs a late-comer to the Warzone-Black Ops combination, the PPSh-41 showed up on the scene at the beginning of Season 3 with a bang. Call of Duty players have already grown accustomed to selecting out the PPSh in previous Call of Duty titles as a dominant weapon in short-range encounters. Because of this familiarity, many players jumped at the chance to use a favorite from the past that could inspire some new gameplay to enjoy. But does the Warzone version of the PPSh-41 stack up to its predecessors?\n\n## Unlock Criteria\n\nDuring Season 3, players could unlock this weapon by reaching Level 15 of the free version of the Battle Pass. However, since season 3 has ended a while ago now, players will have to complete a challenge to unlock the gun. The challenge, most easily completed in Plunder or Multiplayer, is: 3 kills immediately after sprinting in 15 different completed matches using SMGs. So get out there and get your running in, folks!\n\n## Break It Down\n\n - Damage\n \nAlmost instantly, players noticed the massive damage potential of the PPSh-41 at close ranges. Within 18 meters, the PPSh kills using just 10 bullets with a time to kill of just 595 with chest shots. At the same range, with shots to the head, the time to kill for this gun drops to just 463 using 8 rounds of ammunition. Within the SMG category, this is a pretty strong offering looking strictly at damage and time to kills. A good start, indeed.\n\n - Control\n \nWithin the SMG category, the PPSh is perhaps one of the least desirable options. The PPSh has a very strong recoil pattern that can make it quite difficult to use past even a middling range. Comparable to the Cold War MP5, this weapon is clearly meant for very close range engagements. However, equipping the correct attachments to the PPSh can mitigate this issue by quite a margin, bringing it back to a more manageable recoil profile.\n\n - Fire Rate\n \nJumping over to fire rates, the PPSh is a standout performer - even among strictly submachine guns that can be found in Warzone. With a fire rate registering in at 904, the PPSh comes in as the third fastest fire rate behind only the Fennec and the MAC-10. Coupled with its high damage output, this makes the PPSh-41 a lethal weapon in those close range engagements where high fire rates can be incredibly advantageous.\n\n - Range\n \nRange is not of the PPSh's strong suits for a couple of reasons. First, the damage profile of this weapon sees a drop-off rather early, even for an SMG, making it weaker at even mid-range. Second, the combination of the recoil pattern and high fire rate that this weapon employs makes it very difficult to control beyond 20 meters. So, not only will your shots be difficult to hit, they also will not be as powerful as you are hoping for when you do hit those shots. High risk, little reward.\n\n - Mobility\n \nAgain, the PPSh does not register highly among SMGs in another category. The mobility of the PPSh leaves much to be desired as it shows up as the second to last worst mover of all of the SMGs in Warzone. Beating out only the MAC-10 using no attachments, the PPSh makes its profile quite clear here: I am not for running around doing quadruple bunny hops into triple slide cancels. I am for barrel stuffing your opponent and simply winning on damage.\n\n## Let's Talk Attachments\n\n![enter image description here](/blog/ppsh-loady.png)\n\nAs far as attachments go, you can check out our roster of [Warzone players ](https://www.kittr.gg/games/warzone) to find out what the best Warzone fighters are using.\n\nTo create their close-range body slammer, players on kittr are showing a pretty wide variety of attachments for their builds. What we see most commonly, though, is a few standards. First, it is more common to use the Sound Suppressor over the Agency Suppressor with the PPSh as players aren't looking for that long-range potential. Next, the 15.7\" Task Force Barrel is employed in an attempt to keep things a little steadier. A boost to mobility is brought in by using the Tiger Team Spotlight in the Laser slot while the Raider Stock is also employed for similar gains. Last, players sort of split themselves on how much ammo they want to have available with for the weapon. It appears to be more common to use the 55 Rnd Drum than the 71 Rnd to maintain nice aiming down sights time while still getting more ammo to work with. With all that said, be sure to play around with your PPSh to get it just right for your needs.\n\n## Wrap It Up\n\nThe PPSh-41 is a powerhouse in the Verdansk scene, to be sure. However, a player that is wielding this weapon does need to be mindful of the situations in which it will truly shine. In short range encounters, the PPSh can be nothing short of domminant. However, you won't want to do much dancing in these cases and you also won't want to try to use this weapon as a sniper support either. If you stay within our guidelines for how to use the PPSh, you're going to have a good time. But if you don't...play at your own risk.",

      "\n# Tourney Wrap: $100K Warzone ROKKR Royale Tournament\n\nWelcome one and all to this ROKKR sponsored tournament, featuring fun, competition, and a big ol' purse of $100,000! This tournament was a bit unconventional as it wasn't your standard slay-fest. However, it was just as entertaining (if not, more) than your old fashioned, run-of-the-mill tournament. Let's start with some details...\n\n## Surveying the Field\n\n![enter image description here](https://resources.esportsinsider.com/esportsinsider/2019/10/Minnesota-Rokkr-Logo.jpeg)\n\nHonestly, there are too many great players to sit here and list them all out. If you know their name, they are probably in this tourney. Even with everyone travelling for COD Champs. However, we will detail the kittr roster members that were in this tourney:\n- JoeWo\n- exzachtt\n- almxnd\n- scummn\n- newbz\n- stukawaki\n\n## The Format\n\nAs we were saying, this tournament was a little bit - um, unconventional. Broken up into two days of pro customs lobbies, the first day featured three games with non-standard formats while the second day featured five games of a more normal ruleset as we have come to expect out of pro custom Warzone gamesmanship.\n\n## Day 1\n\nAs we mentioned, Day 1 featured three content-y games so we won't go into too much depth on them. Players enjoyed these games as taking the top spot earned them $6,000!\n\nThe rules for Game 1 were: ground loot only. You can get perks and equipment from your loadout but that's it. Kills don't count for anything. All you need is placement. With the ground loot this season being pretty trying, this game featured a lot more missed shots than usual.\n\nThe rules for Game 2: Handguns and snipers only. Kills still don't matter and winningThis one was entertaining and featured a lot of Diamattis for loadouts. Altogether, it did seem like the players enjoyed this game more than the first.\n\nThe rules for Game 3 almost looked like a standard pro custom lobby with one small yet large difference: only placement matters. We are used to seeing kills being meaningful in these Battle Royale battles (um?) but it's Day 1 of the ROKKR Royale Tournament so we're throwing a twist into things. As you'd predict, zones became extremely dense the longer that games continued with players only taking fights when they were absolutely forced to.\n\n## Day 2\n\nOkay, here we have some more normal gameplay for our pros to engage in. With kills counting for points and multipliers like the players are accustomed to, the games fleshed out in a much more familiar way. Let's see how they went.\n\n### Game 1\n\nFirst game start! Oh, wait, first game end just as quickly! Almxnd got a dev error before he ever even hit the ground, leading to a reset.\n\nOkay, now first game start! Oh...Unfortunately, Almxnd crashed again but they aren't going to reset again. Play on, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nJumping to the 5th zone ending at the gas station southeast of Port, a ton of teams died out as 6th zone began its close. Aydan found an especially cheeky hiding spot to prone out on top of the cliff and let his feet hang into zone. With four teams still jockeying for the win, a solo player managed to get a pressure-packed double buy-back to complete their trio. This did amount to nothing but extra points in the end, however, as there was one complete team that had the earliest position inside the gas station and managed to hold it the entire endgame. That team, earning the win for Game 1, was LuckyChamu, Repullze, and SuperEvan!\n\n### Game 2\n\nNo drama this time! With the zone coming down on the hilly area outside of the wall above Military Base, a big gunfight broke out involving at least seven teams. At the end of all of those bullets flying, it came down to a 2v2 featuring two members of the previous game's winning trio, Repullze and SuperEvan! After a pretty quick skirmish between the two still-standing duos, a back-to-back win streak was locked in for LuckyChamu, Repullze, and SuperEvan! And, even crazier than that, LuckyChamu actually had his game crash at the beginning of the game, leaving Repullze and SuperEvan to take the victory as a duo!\n\n### Game 3\n\nAs it turns out, LuckyChamu is still out of the game because his house lost power, again leaving Repullze and SuperEvan to play as a duo. Running down to the end of the match, the zone ended in a really difficult spot in the absolute top right corner of the map in the hills, bluffs, and trees of Verdansk. This accounted for a *ton* of early deaths for many players due to long and treacherous rotations. At the end of it all, a team pinging in all the way from Europe pulled out the win! Welcome to the stage, Italian trio GSK_savyultras90, GSK BBlade, and kyborgTV!\n\n### Game 4\n\nAgain, the ending zone finds us in tough terrain at the northeast corner of the map. This time, we're looking a little more southern, though, as the zone came down finally on the satellite crash in the frozen river in front of the fire station. Again, another great gunfight broke out with SuperEvan, Repullze and LuckyChamu right there in the mix! Several vehicles were even utilized in the final moving circles but, after it all, zJelly, Stukawaki, and Pieman took home the win in this one.\n\n### Game 5\n\nWith the tourney coming towards its finish and a lot of points still up for grabs in a tight podium race, teams were working hard to eke out every last that they could from Verdansk. The zone began to center itself on the northern end of port to finish up the tournament and, suddenly, a huge gunfight involving nearly 12 teams broke out. In what could only amount to an action movie, guns and ammo were flying around in perhaps the tournaments best skirmish yet. After the dust had settled, the only team left standing was...The winners from Game 3! GSK_savyultras90, GSK BBlade, and kyborgTV!\n\n## Final Results for Day 2\n\nAt the end of it all, the top 6 teams were awarded money, with top honors going to LuckyChamu, Repullze, and SuperEvan. The full leaderboard is as follows;\n1. Team SuperEvan - $25,000\n2. Team savyultras90 - $25,000\n3. Team Picnick - $12,000\n4. Team Frozone - $7,500\n5. Team CPentagon_ - $6,000\n6. Team Sensei Swishem - $4,500\n\n![enter image description here](https://cdn.charlieintel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17163232/warzone-rokkr-tournament-standings-6.jpg)",
